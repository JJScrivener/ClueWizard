# ClueWizard
An advanced clue tracking Android mobile application for Cluedo (AKA Clue)

To install download the latest release then open AndroidStudio and open a new project. Click on the pom.xml and select open as new project. You can then connect your device and install the application. As of June 22 2020 the app is not on the play store but I plan on adding there in the future.
